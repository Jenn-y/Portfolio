Hi stranger/friend ðŸ‘‹

Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me.
I am a final-year student pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a minor in Economics at the University Sarajevo School of Science and Technology. 

Apart from being a full-time student, I am a highly active volunteer in various organizations of the non-governmental sector for over 5 years now. I believe it to be an incredible opportunity for personal and professional growth while surrounding yourself with the people that are truly making an impact on society.

Over the years, my combination of formal and informal education resulted in acquiring various experience in software development, project and team management, communication, leadership, and many other skills and topics, details for which you can see further on my profile.

As an overall curious person and an aspiring engineer and entrepreneur, I am always open to new opportunities and knowledge sharing.
